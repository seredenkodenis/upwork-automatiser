This project was created to automate tracking on the Upwork freelance platform. My problem was that my friend had to use Upwork-tracker but he was worried about Security. That's why I wrote a programm that imitates working process.


## Features

- simulation of work while you are not working
- auto click on the desired area
- auto pressing the desired buttons
- saving/loading previously made scripts
- setup time how much time you want to track(10, 20 hours etc.)
- amount of clicks - you can specify how many times it will be clicked. As example, you can use it to cheat for cookie clicker ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

## Requirements for development
